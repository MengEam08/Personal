        <p>
          I come from a small, close-knit family where each member plays a
          significant role in shaping who I am. My mother, Cheng Kech Im, is a
          kind and resilient woman who manages our household with care, while my
          father, Peng Seng, is a dedicated farmer who works tirelessly in the
          fields to provide for us. Their hard work has instilled in me a strong
          sense of responsibility and perseverance. My older brother, Seng
          KimHeng, is in his last year at university, pursuing a degree in
          electrical engineering. He’s always been an inspiration to me,
          balancing his studies with a determination to succeed, and I look up
          to him not just as a sibling, but also as a role model. We also have
          my uncle, Chay, who lives with us. Despite his disability, he remains
          an integral part of our family. His strength and courage in facing
          daily challenges remind me of the importance of resilience and
          compassion. Two years ago, we faced a great loss when my grandmother
          passed away. She was a guiding light in our lives, offering wisdom and
          love that still resonate with us today. Her absence is deeply felt,
          but her memory continues to influence the values we hold dear. Our
          family might be small, but the love and support we share are
          boundless. We’ve faced many challenges together, but it’s these
          experiences that have made our bond stronger. We continue to support
          one another, finding strength in our unity and cherishing the moments
          we have together.
