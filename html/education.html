            I graduated from HUN SEN Saang High School in 2021. During my time
            there, I was truly happy. The environment was welcoming and
            supportive, even though the school was smaller compared to a
            university. I cherished the ample time I had to spend with my
            friends, creating lasting memories. The teachers were exceptional,
            providing us with not only strong academic training but also
            valuable advice and life lessons. Their dedication contributed
            greatly to our personal and intellectual growth, making our high
            school years some of the best in our lives.

            In the past few months, I graduated from the PUC-Institute of
            Foreign Languages, and it was an incredibly happy time for me. The
            teachers were not just educators but also kind mentors who guided me
            with patience. My friends were friendly and supportive, making every
            moment enjoyable. I really miss them all. The connections I made
            there and the experiences we shared left a lasting impact on me.
            Moving on is bittersweet, but I carry with me fond memories and the
            hope that these friendships will endure.

            The Center of Science and Technology Advanced Development, or <strong>CSTAD</strong>,
            provided me with invaluable knowledge in programming and technology,
            along with valuable advice for both me and my friends through the
            scholarships they offered. My time there was filled with both fun
            and challenging moments, creating memories that I will never forget.
            I deeply miss my friends from CSTAD, and I am truly grateful to the
            president and my teachers for their support and guidance.

            Nowadays, I am a student in my fourth year at the Royal University
            of Phnom Penh, majoring in Computer Science. University life is
            quite different from my time in high school. I have less free time,
            and the challenges are more demanding. However, over the past three
            years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to meet many new friends, build
            valuable connections, and receive a wealth of advice and knowledge
            from both peers and professors. This journey has significantly
            contributed to my personal and academic growth, preparing me for
            future endeavors.
